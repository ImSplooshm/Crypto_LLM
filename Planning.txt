---------
STEP ONE
---------
Set up the backtesting framework
Possible libraries:
-Lumibot?
  -Free to use with alpaca, accurate, easy to use to live trade/paper trade/backtest
-CoinGecko API
  -Very accurate, easier to perform data analysis since data is more accessible
-CryptoDataPy
  -Allows a lot of data to be downloaded at once, order books might be less accessible
-Yahoo Finance
  -I've had experience with this previously, I imagine I'll be using this
Needed Libraries:
-datetime
-pandas

Wanted Libraries:
-colorama

STEP 2
---------
Data Analysis and Cleaning

-If missing value: extrapolate between nearest values
-Range of classes/functions analysing a crypto
  -Correlations with different variables
  -Price distribution exploration
  -TA values?
    -Already coded a functioning TA function library so could make use of this
  -Arbitrage correlation with other values
    -For example, similar to gold vs stocks, as gold increases in value, stocks decrease; maybe Forex decreases slightly if crypto becomes more favourable

---------
STEP 3
---------
Start to develop ML models

Possible methods:
-Random forests
  -Very addaptive, takes many inputs
-Linear regression
  -Unreliable normally, but correlation could occur if I use order books to predict sign and magnitude of movements since cypto movement is largely based on previous prices, compared to stocks/forex which takes a lot of news influence.
